## Testing overview & environment

Testing was ongoing throughout the entire development. I used the various linters and GITPOD terminal output whilst building to pinpoint and troubleshoot any issues as I went along.

### Test environment
The application was tested on various devices to ensure it works well across different platforms:
* Desktop:
  * Dell Inspiron : The application was primarily tested on a Dell Inspiron desktop, ensuring that it functions correctly on standard desktop hardware.

* Screen:
  * OnePlus 9R : Tested on this Android device to verify performance and responsiveness on mid-range smartphones.
  * Apple iPhone 13 : Verified compatibility with Apple's iOS ecosystem, ensuring that the app runs smoothly on an iPhone.
  * Samsung A32 5G: Additional testing was performed on this Android device to ensure the application performs well on higher-end smartphones.


### Browser compatibility
The application was tested on the following browsers to ensure consistent performance:
* Google Chrome
* Firefox
* Microsoft Edge

### Responsiveness

App is fully responsive on breakpoints supported by Bootstrap 5.3.3.

| **Breakpoint** | **Prefix** | **Minimum Width** |
|----------------|------------|-------------------|
| Extra Small    | `xs`       | `< 576px`         |
| Small          | `sm`       | `≥ 576px`         |
| Medium         | `md`       | `≥ 768px`         |
| Large          | `lg`       | `≥ 992px`         |
| Extra Large    | `xl`       | `≥ 1200px`        |
| Extra Extra Large | `xxl`   | `≥ 1400px`        |

## Code Validation

### HTML Validation

All HTML files were validated using the recommended [HTML W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org).

To validate pages with Jinja and authentication:

- Log in to the deployed site and navigate to the page.
- Right-click and select "View Page Source" 
- Copy the rendered HTML and paste it into the W3C Validator's "Validate by Direct Input" section.
- Repeat for each page.

#### Home Page
![home-page-html-validation](documentation/docs_images/testing/home-page-html-validation.png)

#### Browse Recipes Page
![browse-recipes-page-html-validation](documentation/docs_images/testing/browse-recipes-page-html-validation.png)

#### Recipe Detail Page
![recipes-detail-page-html-validation](documentation/docs_images/testing/recipes-detail-page-html-validation.png)

#### New Flavors Page
![new-flavors-page-html-validation](documentation/docs_images/testing/new-flavors-page-html-validation.png)

The errors identified by W3Validator on the "New Flavors Page" are related to Summernote, not my code. According to feedback from the Code Institute community, this is a common issue. Therefore, it should be noted, but no action is needed.

#### Edit Flavors Page
![edit-flavors-page-html-validation](documentation/docs_images/testing/edit-flavors-page-html-validation.png)

Similarly, the errors on the "Edit Flavors Page" are also linked to Summernote and not my code. The Code Institute community has observed that this is a frequent problem. Therefore, it should be noted, but no action is needed.

#### Recipe Confirm Delete Page
![recipe-confirm-delete-page-html-validation](documentation/docs_images/testing/recipe-confirm-delete-page-html-validation.png)

#### Sign Up Page
![sign-up-page-html-validation](documentation/docs_images/testing/sign-up-page-html-validation.png)

The HTML code for the Sign Up page is generated by the Django authentication form, which I can't modify. The HTML errors are due to how Django handles allauth's helper text, not because of anything I wrote. Therefore, no changes have been made.

#### Log In Page
![log-in-page-html-validation](documentation/docs_images/testing/log-in-page-html-validation.png)

#### Log Out Page
![logout-page-html-validation](documentation/docs_images/testing/log-out-page-html-validation.png)

#### 403 Error Page
![403-error-page-html-validation](documentation/docs_images/testing/403-error-pages-html-validation.png)

#### 404 Error Page

#### 500 Error Page
![500-error-page-html-validation](documentation/docs_images/testing/500-error-pages-html-validation.png)

### CSS Validation
[CSS Jigsaw Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator) was used to to validate the CSS file.

![css-validation](documentation/docs_images/testing/css-validation.png)

### Python Validation

The recommended [CI Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com) was used to validate all Python files.

## Bug Overview

### Solved Bugs

**1.** LinkedIn Page Link Not Accessible

  - **Issue:** The LinkedIn link in the footer was leading to a "Page not found 404" error.
  - **Fix:** Added https:// to the LinkedIn URL in the footer, ensuring the link directs correctly to the LinkedIn page.

**2.** Hero Background Image Not Visible After Deployment
  - **Issue:** The hero background image on the home page, hosted on Cloudinary, was not displaying after deploying the site on Heroku.
  - **Fix:** Resolved the issue by running the collectstatic command in the terminal and adding the CLOUDINARY_URL to the Reveal Config Vars in Heroku.

**3.** Forbidden 403 CSRF Verification Error
  - **Issue:** Encountered a "Forbidden 403 CSRF Verification" error when accessing the site after deploying on Heroku.
  - **Fix:** Added the CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS field to settings.py to include the necessary domains. The following lines were added to resolve the issue:
  ```python
  CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS = [
    "https://*.codeinstitute-ide.net",
    "https://*.herokuapp.com"
  ]
  ```
  - Resolved the issue based on guidance from [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12174040/forbidden-403-csrf-verification-failed-request-aborted)

**4.** Invalid filter: 'crispy'
  - **Issue:** The error Invalid filter: 'crispy' suggests that Django Crispy Forms may not be properly installed or configured.
  - **Fix:** 
    - Installed Django Crispy Forms using pip : `pip install django-crispy-forms `.
    - Added crispy_forms to INSTALLED_APPS in settings.py: 
      ```
      INSTALLED_APPS = [
        ...
        'crispy_forms',
        ]
      ```
    - Specified the template pack to be used by Crispy Forms in settings.py : 
      `CRISPY_TEMPLATE_PACK = 'bootstrap5'`
    - Ensured that the `{% load crispy_forms_tags %}` statement is included at the top of your HTML templates where Crispy Forms is used

**5.** Slug Field Not Auto-Populated in Admin Panel
  - **Issue:** The slug field in the admin panel wasn’t automatically filled in based on the title, which caused errors like "duplicate key value violates unique constraint."
    - IntegrityError occurred when attempting to save a new recipe with a non-unique slug value.
  - **Fix:** This bug occurs when the slug field is empty or not unique, resulting in a conflict when saving new or existing recipes.
    - To fix this, I imported 'slugify' from 'django.template.defaultfilters'.
    - I then overrode the save method in the Recipe model to ensure slugs are unique:
      ```python
      from django.template.defaultfilters import slugify

      def save(self, *args, **kwargs):
        self.slug = slugify(self.title)
        super().save(*args, **kwargs)
      ```
  - Resolved the issue based on guidance from [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31162620/django-slugs-key-slug-is-duplicated)

**6.** Success Message Not Displayed After Recipe Deletion
  - **Issue:** The success message did not show up after a recipe was deleted. This was because the 'DeleteRecipe' view used a static URL for 'success_url' and had issues with handling success messages.
  - **Fix:**
      - Changed the static URL to use reverse_lazy, which dynamically finds the URL based on its name.
      ```python
        from django.urls import reverse_lazy

        success_url = reverse_lazy('recipe_list')
      ```
      - Adjusted the view to correctly display success messages after deleting a recipe.
      - Added settings to style success messages with Bootstrap alert classes in settings.py.
      ```python
        from django.contrib.messages import constants as messages

        MESSAGE_TAGS = {
            messages.DEBUG: 'alert-secondary',
            messages.INFO: 'alert-info',
            messages.SUCCESS: 'alert-success',
            messages.WARNING: 'alert-warning',
            messages.ERROR: 'alert-danger',
        }
      ```

**7.** 500 Error When Updating Recipe Image on Heroku
  - **Issue:** The app shows a 500 Internal Server Error on Heroku when updating a recipe with a new image, even though it works fine locally. This is due to an issue with Cloudinary image handling.
  - **Fix:** The `CLOUDINARY_URL` on Heroku was incorrect. I replaced it with the correct value to fix the issue.

**8.** Incorrect Field Used for Filtering Recipes
  - **Issue:** The RecipesList view attempted to filter recipes using cuisines_type__icontains=query, but this field does not exist in the Recipe model.
  - **Fix:** Changed `cuisines_type__icontains=query` to `cuisine_type__name__icontains=query` to properly filter recipes by the name of the cuisine type.

**9.** Filtering on ForeignKey Field Using icontains
  - **Issue:** Attempting to use icontains on a ForeignKey field raised an error, as icontains is not supported for ForeignKey lookups.
  - **Fix:** Replaced `author__icontains=query` with `author__username__icontains=author_query` to correctly filter by the author's username.

**10.** NoReverseMatch Error for Login URL
  - **Issue:** The NoReverseMatch error occurred because the login view was referenced with `{% url 'login' %}`, but Django Allauth provides the login view under the account namespace.
  - **Fix:** Replaced `{% url 'login' %}` with `{% url 'account_login' %}` in the 'recipe-details.html' template to correctly link to the login page provided by Django Allauth.

### Unsolved Bugs

**1.** Image Field Not Showing Previously Uploaded Image
- When editing a recipe in the "Edit Flavor" page, the image field (featured_image) does not display the currently uploaded image. Instead, it only shows a "Choose File" button, and there is no indication of the existing image.
  - The image field in the Recipe model uses Cloudinary for handling image uploads.
  - The form used for editing (NewFlavorsForm) includes the featured_image field.
  - In the template (edit_recipe.html), the form is rendered using Crispy Forms, but the previously uploaded image is not displayed.
  - Proper Functioning of the Edit Flavor Page:
    - The "Edit Flavor" page correctly renders the form for editing a recipe. The form includes fields for updating the recipe's title, description, ingredients, instructions, and more.
    - When uploading a new image, the form allows file selection and proper handling of the new image with Cloudinary.
    - After successfully updating a recipe, a success message is displayed confirming the update.
  - Expected Behavior: 
    - Users should be able to edit all recipe details, including uploading a new image. The previously uploaded image should be visible or replaced as needed.

    ![unsolved-bug-edit-flavor-page-currently-image-field](documentation/docs_images/testing/unsolved-bug-edit-flavor-page-currently-image-field.png)

**2.** Custom Styles Not Applying to Ingredients and Instructions Fields

- Custom CSS styles are not applying to the ingredients and instructions fields on both the "Edit Flavor" "New Flavor" pages. These fields use the SummernoteWidget, which renders a rich text editor, and custom styles are not being reflected as expected.
  - The SummernoteWidget is used for ingredients and instructions fields in the NewFlavorsForm form.
  - Custom CSS has been applied to other fields, but not to these Summernote editors.
  - Attempts to apply custom CSS to the Summernote editors have not resulted in any visible changes.
  - The SummernoteWidget might be applying its own styles or overriding the custom CSS due to specificity or inline styles.
  - Attempts to apply custom styles, including the use of !important declarations, have been unsuccessful.
