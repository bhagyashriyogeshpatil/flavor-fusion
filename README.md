## System Architecture

### Application Structure
Flavor Fusion is designed using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern, which divides the application into three key components: Model, View, and Controller. This structure helps organize the code, making development and collaboration more manageable.

The frontend is created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a focus on a mobile-first, responsive design. Bootstrap is utilized for its extensive library of pre-styled components and a responsive grid system, which speeds up development and ensures a smooth user experience on all devices.

The backend is powered by Python and Django. Django handles the backend logic, URL routing, and database interactions, providing a solid and efficient foundation for the application.

For data storage, the project uses a relational database, PostgreSQL, known for its robustness and scalability. The database stores user and recipe information in a structured manner, which optimizes data retrieval and supports complex queries efficiently.

*<span style="color: blue;">[Back to Content](#table-of-contents)</span>*   


### Backend Logic
Flavor Fusion uses models such as `Recipe`, `Comment`, and `CuisineType`. Each `Recipe` is linked to a `CuisineType` and can have multiple Comments. Each `Comment` is tied to a specific `Recipe` and `User`.

Django views handle all the main functions like creating, updating, reading, and deleting recipes and comments. User login and roles are managed using Django's built-in authentication, which keeps the system secure.

The backend also supports features like liking recipes and approving comments. Tools like Cloudinary manage recipe images, and Summernote widgets are used for rich text editing of ingredients and instructions.

This setup ensures a secure, easy-to-use platform for sharing and managing recipes.

*<span style="color: blue;">[Back to Content](#table-of-contents)</span>*   

### Programming Paradigms

The application uses various programming paradigms to achieve its functionality:

**Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** Models like Recipe and Comment use classes to represent and manage data. Django's views and forms also leverage OOP principles for reusability and organization.

**Functional Programming:** Some views are written as functions to handle specific tasks, processing inputs and returning responses.

**Declarative Programming:** The Django ORM and forms use a declarative style to define data structures and form fields, abstracting away complex query and presentation logic.

**Event-Driven Programming:** The app responds to user actions and requests, such as form submissions and comment postings, using a request-response model.

**MVC Pattern:** Django follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern, with Models handling data, Views managing user interactions, and Controllers (or view functions) processing requests and responses.

*<span style="color: blue;">[Back to Content](#table-of-contents)</span>*  

## Agile Development Process

### Agile Planning

For this project, I implemented an Agile methodology, organizing the entire process using a GitHub project board. This approach allowed me to manage the development from the initial planning stages to the final deployment. The project was divided into 10 milestones, each representing a key phase of the development process, ensuring that progress was systematic and aligned with the projectâ€™s goals.

You can view the full Project Board, complete with all user stories and progress tracking, here: <a href="https://github.com/users/bhagyashriyogeshpatil/projects/2" target="_blank">Github Project board</a>

#### **User Stories and Management:**

- **Acceptance Criteria:** Each user story was developed with specific acceptance criteria to ensure clarity and focus. This approach guaranteed that every task met the necessary requirements before being marked as complete.

- **MoSCoW Prioritization:** To manage priorities effectively, features were categorized using the MoSCoW method - 'Must have', 'Should have'and 'Could have'. This prioritization ensured that the core features (MVP) were developed first, with secondary features added if time permitted.

## Data Modeling and Database Design

### Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)

The Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) provides a visual representation of the database's structure. It helps in planning and illustrating the SQL tables and the relationships between them. The ERD is an essential part of the database design that shows the entities, their attributes, and the types of relationships among the entities.

The ER diagram was created with dbdiagram.io [dbdiagram.io](https://dbdiagram.io/home)
to show how the models in the app are structured and related.

![ERD](documentation/docs_images/ERD-flavor-fusion.png)

*<span style="color: blue;">[Back to Content](#table-of-contents)</span>*   

### Database Schema

The database schema is designed to efficiently manage and store data related to recipes, comments, and user interactions within the application.

The ER diagram was created with dbdiagram.io [dbdiagram.io](https://dbdiagram.io/home)
to show how the models in the app are structured and related. The Recipe model has all the key fields like title, ingredients, and instructions needed for a complete recipe. This design makes sure the website works well and gives users a great experience.

The ER diagram showcases the relationships between the Recipe model, Comment model, CuisineType model and Django's built-in User model (user_django_built_in_model) as follows:

- **User to Recipe: One-to-Many (1:M)**
    - Each user can create multiple recipes.
    - Each recipe is associated with one user.
- **Recipe to Comment: One-to-Many (1:M)**
    - Each recipe can have multiple comments.
    - Each comment is associated with one recipe.
- **User to Comment: One-to-Many (1:M)**
    - Each user can make multiple comments.
    - Each comment is associated with one user.
- **CuisineType to Recipe: One-to-Many (1:M)**:
    - Each cuisine type can be associated with multiple recipes.
    - Each recipe is associated with one cuisine type.

**Summary of Relationships:**
- **User to Recipe (1:M):**
A user can create multiple recipes, but each recipe is created by one user.
- **Recipe to Comment (1:M):**
A recipe can have multiple comments, but each comment is tied to a single recipe.
- **User to Comment (1:M):**
A user can make multiple comments, but each comment is made by a single user.
- **CuisineType to Recipe (1:M)**:
  A cuisine type can have multiple recipes, but each recipe is associated with only one cuisine type.

These relationships were implemented using ForeignKey fields in the Django models:
- The `Recipe` model includes a `ForeignKey` field (`author`) that references the `User` model to denote the creator of the recipe.
- The `Comment` model includes `ForeignKey` fields (`recipe` and `author`) that reference the `Recipe` and `User` models respectively, indicating the recipe being commented on and the user making the comment.
- The `Recipe` model includes a `ForeignKey` field (`cuisine_type`) that references the `CuisineType` model to denote the type of cuisine for the recipe.

Additionally, a many-to-many relationship is established between the `Recipe` model and the `User` model to facilitate the "likes" feature, where users can like multiple recipes.

The `likes` feature is implemented as a **many-to-many(M:M)** relationship between the `Recipe` and `User` models using Django's `ManyToManyField`. Although Django automatically creates a join table for this, itâ€™s not explicitly shown in the ER diagram.

In the dbdiagram.io code, this relationship is represented directly between the Recipe and user_django_built_in_model tables using the following reference:

```
// The many-to-many relationship between Recipe and user_django_built_in_model for likes

Ref: recipe.id < user_django_built_in_model.id [label: "likes", note: "Many-to-Many relationship"]
```
In the dbdiagram.io code, this relationship is represented by a reference label, though the details may not appear directly in the visual diagram, keeping the design clean and focused.
